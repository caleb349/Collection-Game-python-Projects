# Collection-Game-python-Projects
Python program that allows users to input basic demographic information (minimum of three pieces of demographic information) and then to create a collection of three items, with each item having at least two pieces of metadata attached to them. After this initial phase of the game, each user is allowed to try and guess an item from the other's collection. Each user can only have X guesses (you define X, e.g., you could allow a user guess a maximum of 10 times) before the game ends. You can alternate guessing or have one user guess all their guesses at one time.
